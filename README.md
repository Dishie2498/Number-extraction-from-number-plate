# Number-extraction-from-number-plate
As getting the licence number of the vehicle breaking traffic rules in moving traffic is difficult, the aim of this project is to make that task easier. Here, using the connected components labelling method, an OpenCV tool, we have made a system that can extract the numbers from an image of a number plate and can store it in a different picture.
